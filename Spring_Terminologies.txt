Okay let's talk about them.


# Dependency Injection =>


Dependency means thet, when one class is dependent on the another class. So we need to have the object of that class to move further and typically me manually create the object of the class. Now here the concept of dependency injection occurs, it says that the spring framework will injection or return the object of that depending class by itself, with the help of configuration.


# Inversion of Control =>

When we give the control of creating and injecting the object of a class to the spring framework, then it is termed as Inversion of Control.
